Task 2: BMI Calculator with Categorization

I broke down the program in steps as follows:
1. start the program by defining the main function ('def main()').
2. check if the CSV file exists; if not, write the header (more detail in choosing os.path.isfile() and os.path.exists() below).
3. prompt the user for their name.
4. prompt the user for their weight in kilograms.
5. prompt the user for their height in centimeters.
6. convert height from centimeters to meters.
7. calculate the BMI using the formula: BMI = weight / (height in meters)Â².
8. determine the BMI category based on the calculated BMI.
9. create a formatted result string: name, weight, height, bmi, categorization.
10. open a CSV file in append mode and write the result to the file.
11. inform the user that the results have been saved.
12. call the main function to run the program.

This program uses a couple of materials that were not discussed in CSY1020's learning materials including:
- os.path.isfile() from Python's official documentation website (https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#module-os.path)
